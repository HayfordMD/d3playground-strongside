Our goal is to create a chart that shows the drive of a football game on a visual filterData
We will have the data in a game breakdown data file to use as demonstration Data
The page will need a simple plot that looks like a football field We don't want to make it overwhelmingly complex so that it is easy to use an llm model to create the chart
Each play will be a column on the chart
The columns will be colored based on the play type
The length of the column will be related to the yards gained or load
We will use a stacked chart for continuing gains or continuing losses
Each play will be able to be hovered and show a link to the video of the Play
The chart will be interactive and responsive
We will use a library d3js to create the chart
