Prompts used


Create vs Formation Page
The page witl be a bar chart that starts out filered as Formations on the left and a stacked bar chart for run pass as counts so 

Formation Name |  Stacksection1 is count of Run | Stack section2 is count of runs
the hieght of the stack is relative to the formation
So a formation with more couont will be larger then a formation with fewer counts

The formation name can be clicked and then the page is transformed into two pie charts specific to that formation 1 pie as concepts by count in the select formation and a pie chart that is average yards gained by concept in that formation.

There is a filter by down 
And a slider with a min max to select the distance to filter by. 

There is a button filter for qtr. more then one QTR can be selected at a time
